docker-R3.X
===========

This installs R on top of the docker-r-base image.

If you use the `latest` tag, you'll have the latest version of R which currently is 3.4.2.

The LANG is set to use UTF-8 encoding so its internationally friendly.

## Note
This is an "unofficial" docker image, use at own risk.
